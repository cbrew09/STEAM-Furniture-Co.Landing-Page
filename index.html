                    <img src="img/lectureHall.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>In 2016, our founder had an idea during his Entrepreneurship class to create furniture that would
                        inspire students to create and innovate, and that would make their environment conducive to learning.
                        3 years later, we're proud to say that we service 40 school districts with premium furniture designed 
                        for STEAM programs. Could your school be the next to produce a Tesla, Einstein, or Rachmaninoff? 
                        Help your students get in the mindset by supplying them with comfort and creativity all at the same time.
